This repository contains my solution to the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/ "Spaceship Titanic") problem.\
**The goal** is to predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension.
My solution achieved 0.8057 accuracy score.

My notebook has EDA, work with Missing values, hyperparameter tuning.

Also, one of my first solutions, which was a trial and just a draft, whitout EDA, insight search, trying to filling the missing values according to insights, achieved a score of 0.81038, which is in the top 4%. This solution is in the *without-eda* branch.

I will continue to work on this task to achieve a better result, taking into account insights. I think it should bring good results.
